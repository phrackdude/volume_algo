# Volume Cluster Trading Strategy Documentation

## üìñ **Strategy Overview**

The Volume Cluster Trading Strategy is a systematic approach to futures trading that exploits short-term directional price movements following significant intraday volume spikes. The strategy is based on the hypothesis that **price exhibits predictable directional drift after volume clusters form at key support/resistance levels**.

### **Core Concept**
- **Volume Clusters**: Identify 1-minute candles with volume ‚â•4x the rolling average (optimized from 5x)
- **Modal Price Analysis**: Calculate the most frequently traded price within each cluster
- **Directional Bias**: Determine trade direction based on modal price position within the cluster's price range
- **Confirmation Logic**: Require momentum confirmation before entering trades
- **Risk Management**: Dynamic position sizing with profit targets and volatility-based stop losses

## üîß **How The Strategy Works**

### **Step 1: Volume Cluster Detection**
```python
# Identify clusters with exceptional volume
volume_threshold = 4.0x average_volume  # Optimized for balance
clusters = identify_volume_clusters(data, volume_threshold)
```

### **Step 2: Modal Price Positioning**
```python
# Normalize modal price position (0-1 scale)
modal_position = (modal_price - cluster_low) / (cluster_high - cluster_low)

# Directional signals (loosened thresholds):
# Long if modal_position ‚â§ 0.28 (bottom 28% = support)
# Short if modal_position ‚â• 0.72 (top 28% = resistance)
```

### **Step 3: Signal Quality Assessment**
```python
# Multi-factor signal strength calculation
signal_strength = (
    0.5 * position_strength +      # How extreme the modal position
    0.3 * volume_strength +        # Relative volume intensity
    0.2 * momentum_strength        # Pre-cluster price momentum
)
```

### **Step 4: Entry Conditions**
1. **Retest Requirement**: Price must return to within ¬±0.75 ticks of modal price
2. **Confirmation Candle**: Next candle must close in trade direction
3. **Time Filter**: Only trade during 14:00-17:30 CET (prime session)
4. **Quality Filter**: Only top 3 volume clusters per day by strength (increased from 2)

### **Step 5: Position Management**
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: 1.09x-1.47x based on signal strength and volume quality
- **Profit Targets**: 2:1 risk/reward ratio (53.7% hit rate)
- **Stop Loss**: 1.0-sigma volatility-based (37.9% hit rate)
- **Transaction Costs**: Explicit accounting for commission ($2.50) + slippage (0.75 ticks)
