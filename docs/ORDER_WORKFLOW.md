# 📋 V6 Bayesian Trading System - Daily Workflow

## 🌅 **Daily Trading Routine**

### **Morning Setup (Before Market Open - 8:30 AM EST)**

**1. System Startup (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Navigate to trading system directory
cd /path/to/volume-cluster-analyzer

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Set your API key for the session
export DATABENTO_API_KEY=db-vv7rLkKHSiGx4KAADSmETFbaAjvdf

# Start the main trading system
python launch_trading_system.py
```

**2. Pre-Market Checklist**
- ✅ Verify API connection status
- ✅ Check system configuration summary
- ✅ Review any pending trades from yesterday
- ✅ Confirm market hours and contract selection
- ✅ Set up broker platform for ES futures

**3. System Health Check**
```bash
# In a separate terminal, check system status
python src/trade_feedback.py
# Select option 3: Show Pending Trades
```

### **During Market Hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST)**

**Active Monitoring:**
- 📺 Keep terminal window visible for signal alerts
- 🎯 Have broker platform ready for immediate execution
- 📱 Monitor volume cluster notifications
- 📊 Watch for V6 Bayesian recommendations

**When Signal Appears:**
```
🚨 V6 BAYESIAN TRADING RECOMMENDATION
============================================================
⏰ Time: 2025-06-08 14:32:15
📊 Contract: ES JUN25
📈 Action: BUY                    ← Execute this action
📦 Quantity: 2 contracts          ← Use this position size
💰 Price: $6010.75               ← Limit order price
🎯 Stop Loss: $5995.25            ← Set protective stop
🎯 Profit Target: $6041.25        ← Set profit target
============================================================
```

### **End of Day Routine (After 4:00 PM EST)**

**1. System Shutdown**
- Stop trading system (Ctrl+C)
- Record any manual exits in feedback system
- Review day's performance

**2. Performance Review**
```bash
# Check trading statistics
sqlite3 data/bayesian_stats.db "SELECT * FROM context_performance ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Review recommendation log
tail -10 data/recommendations_log.jsonl
```

## 🎯 **Order Types & Execution Details**

### **Current Order Configuration:**
- **Default Order Type**: `LIMIT` orders (precise execution at signal price)
- **Validity**: `DAY` orders (expire at market close)
- **Alternative Options**: `MARKET`, `GTC`, `IOC`, `STOP_LIMIT`

### **Your Order Execution Steps:**

**1. When Signal Appears:**
- 📋 Copy exact recommendation details
- 🏃‍♂️ Move quickly to broker platform (volume clusters are time-sensitive)

**2. Place Order in Broker:**
- **Symbol**: ES JUN25 (or current highest volume contract)
- **Action**: BUY/SHORT (as recommended)
- **Quantity**: Exact contracts recommended (1-3 based on Bayesian scaling)
- **Order Type**: LIMIT (or MARKET for high-confidence signals >80%)
- **Price**: Recommended limit price
- **Stop Loss**: Set as bracket order (automatic)
- **Profit Target**: Set as bracket order (automatic)

**3. Record Execution (CRITICAL):**
```bash
# Immediately after placing order
python src/trade_feedback.py
# Select option 1: Record Order Execution
```

**4. Record Exit (When Trade Closes):**
```bash
# After trade exits (stop, target, or manual)
python src/trade_feedback.py
# Select option 2: Record Trade Exit
```

## 🔄 **Complete Trading Workflow**

### **Step 1: System Generates Signal**
When a volume cluster is detected:
- ✅ System outputs recommendation to terminal
- ✅ Saves to `data/latest_recommendation.json`
- ✅ Logs to `data/recommendations_log.jsonl`
- ✅ Plays audio alert (if configured)

### **Step 2: Execute Your Order (Within 30 seconds)**
**Why Speed Matters**: Volume clusters are time-sensitive market events
- 🏃‍♂️ Quick execution at recommended price maximizes edge
- ⏰ Delayed execution reduces signal effectiveness

**Order Placement:**
```
Broker Order Entry:
Symbol: ES JUN25
Side: BUY (or SHORT)
Quantity: 2 (as recommended)
Order Type: LMT
Price: 6010.75
Stop Loss: 5995.25 (bracket)
Profit Target: 6041.25 (bracket)
Validity: DAY
```

### **Step 3: Record Execution (Within 2 minutes)**
**Critical for Bayesian Learning:**
```
📝 Recording Order Execution
Recommendation timestamp: 2025-06-08T14:32:15
Was order executed? (y/n): y
Fill price: $6010.50
Fill quantity: 2
Execution notes: Filled immediately
✅ Trade recorded: BUY 2 ES JUN25 @ $6010.50
📊 Awaiting exit to complete Bayesian learning cycle
```

### **Step 4: Manage Position**
**Let the System Work:**
- ✅ Trust your backtested 2:1 risk/reward ratio
- ✅ Allow stops and targets to execute automatically
- ⚠️ Avoid emotional overrides (damages Bayesian learning)

### **Step 5: Record Exit (When Position Closes)**
```
📤 Recording Trade Exit
Entry timestamp to close: 2025-06-08T14:32:15
Exit price: $6025.75
Exit reason: target
Exit notes: Hit profit target automatically
✅ Trade completed: WIN 🎉
📊 Return: 0.25%
🧠 Bayesian database updated
```

## 🧠 **Why Your Feedback is Critical**

### **Bayesian Adaptive Learning:**
1. **Context Performance**: System tracks win/loss by market conditions
2. **Position Sizing**: Adapts multipliers based on YOUR actual results
3. **Signal Quality**: Learns which volume clusters work best for YOU
4. **Risk Management**: Adjusts parameters based on YOUR execution

### **Performance Impact:**

**Without Feedback:**
- ⚠️ System stuck at 1.0x position multiplier
- ⚠️ No adaptive learning
- ⚠️ Misses your proven 99% performance improvement
- ⚠️ Returns remain at baseline levels

**With Consistent Feedback:**
- ✅ Position sizing scales to 2-3x for successful contexts
- ✅ Bayesian confidence adapts to your trading style
- ✅ System achieves your backtested 64.7% win rate
- ✅ Returns approach your proven 0.813% per trade

## ⚙️ **System Customization**

### **Order Type Preferences (config.py):**
```python
# Current conservative settings
default_order_type: "LIMIT"
default_validity: "DAY"
limit_offset_ticks: 0.0

# For aggressive execution (high-speed fills)
default_order_type: "MARKET"
use_market_orders_on_high_confidence: True
high_confidence_threshold: 0.75

# For conservative execution (better fills)
limit_offset_ticks: 1.0  # 1 tick better than signal
default_validity: "GTC"  # Good Till Cancelled
```

### **Risk Management Settings:**
```python
max_risk_per_trade: 0.02        # 2% portfolio risk
max_position_size: 3            # Maximum contracts
max_daily_trades: 10            # Safety limit
emergency_stop_loss_pct: 0.05   # 5% drawdown emergency stop
```

## 📊 **Performance Monitoring**

### **Daily Checks:**
```bash
# Check pending trades
python src/trade_feedback.py  # Option 3

# View recent performance
sqlite3 data/bayesian_stats.db "
  SELECT 
    context_value,
    COUNT(*) as trades,
    ROUND(AVG(return_pct)*100, 2) as avg_return_pct,
    ROUND(SUM(win)*100.0/COUNT(*), 1) as win_rate
  FROM context_performance 
  WHERE created_at > date('now', '-7 days')
  GROUP BY context_value
  ORDER BY trades DESC;
"

# Monitor system logs
tail -f data/trading_system.log
```

### **Weekly Performance Review:**
- 📈 **Target Metrics**: ~65% win rate, ~0.8% per trade
- 🎯 **Trade Frequency**: 2-5 signals per week
- 🧠 **Bayesian Usage**: >95% utilization rate
- 💰 **Position Scaling**: Increasing multipliers over time

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

**"No signals generated"**
- ✅ Normal during low volatility periods
- ✅ System waits for 4.0x+ volume spikes
- ✅ Patience required - quality over quantity

**"Order not filled"**
- ⚠️ Fast-moving markets may gap past limit price
- 💡 Consider MARKET orders for high-confidence signals
- 💡 Reduce limit_offset_ticks to 0.0

**"System not learning"**
- ❌ Critical: Must record EVERY trade execution and exit
- ❌ Incomplete feedback breaks Bayesian adaptation
- ✅ Use trade_feedback.py religiously

---

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Expected Performance (Based on Your Backtesting):**
- 📊 **Win Rate**: 64.7% (should stabilize after 20+ trades)
- 💰 **Return per Trade**: 0.813% (position-adjusted)
- 🎯 **Signals per Week**: 2-5 (depending on market volatility)
- 🧠 **Bayesian Multiplier Growth**: 1.0x → 2.5x over 3 months
- 📈 **Performance Improvement**: Up to 99% vs. baseline

### **Monthly Targets:**
- **Month 1**: Establish feedback loop, achieve baseline performance
- **Month 2**: See Bayesian multipliers reaching 1.5-2.0x
- **Month 3**: Target full 99% performance improvement realization

### **📊 Position Sizing Logic:**

**Smart Sizing:**
- **Risk:** 1-2% of portfolio per trade (based on confidence)
- **Bayesian:** Multiplier increases position size as system learns
- **Max:** Never risk more than 10% on single trade
- **Realistic:** Uses $1,000 risk per ES contract assumption

**Example:**
```
$15,000 portfolio → 1.5% risk = $225 → 1 contract
$18,000 portfolio → 2.0% risk = $360 → 1 contract  
$20,000 portfolio → 2.0% risk = $400 → 2 contracts (Bayesian 2.1x)
```
